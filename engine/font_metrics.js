/*
 * font_metrics.js — Arial advance widths, in em units, baked at build time.
 *
 * GENERATED FILE — do not hand-edit. Regenerate with:
 *     node "%SK%\font_metrics_build.js"
 * and check coverage without rewriting with:
 *     node "%SK%\font_metrics_build.js" --check
 *
 * WHY BAKED: the generators must stay deterministic and free of outside reads
 * (changing-the-engine.md §1, invariants 4 and 5). Measuring text from an
 * installed font would make output depend on which Arial a machine has, and
 * the portal renders on a server that may have none. Arial and Liberation Sans
 * are metric-compatible, so these widths hold for the Linux substitution.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS: label collision code guessed width as
 * `text.length * size * 0.52` (gen_internal.js:648, and :1485). Real Arial
 * advances span 0.222em ('i') to 0.944em ('W') — a factor of four — so the
 * guess both invented collisions (labels dropped that would have fitted; it
 * over-estimates a typical name by ~11%) and missed real ones (labels drawn
 * over each other). See Development Docs/label-and-design-quality-plan.
 *
 * 121 glyphs, harvested from every shipped ci-reference sheet.
