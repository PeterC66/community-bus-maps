/*
 * svg_primitives.js — the small marks the internal sheet is drawn out of.
 *
 * CONTRACT. `svgPrimitives(deps)` returns `{ esc, gk, badgeHalfW, badgeXW,
 * badgeXWs, badge, badgeStack }`. It is a FACTORY, not a module of
 * free functions, because four of the eight need the town in scope: the route
 * palette, the text colour on that fill, the badge-label lookup and the font
 * metrics table. `out` is passed in rather than returned from, so the caller
 * keeps ownership of the document — these helpers append to whatever the
 * caller is building and return only measurements.
 *
 * WHAT EACH ONE RETURNS MATTERS, because several call sites measure before
 * they draw: `badge()` returns how much WIDER than the disc it drew (0 for a
 * circle), `badgeStack()` returns `{h, xw}`, and `badgeHalfW`/`badgeXW`/
 * `badgeXWs` answer the same question without drawing anything at all.
 *
 * Extracted from gen_internal.js on 2026-08-27 (OA-129 Phase 3), verbatim.
 * The design.badgeFit reasoning below came with it, because it explains this
 * code and nothing else.

  /* ---- design.badgeFit: a 4-character route key does not fit a disc ------------
   * badge() has always drawn its text at font-size = the badge RADIUS. That is
   * right for one to three characters and wrong for four: "301S" is 5.6mm of Arial
   * Bold in a 4.8mm stop badge, 7.0mm in a 6.0mm terminus badge and 9.3mm in the
   * 8.0mm Services-panel one, so it spilled over BOTH edges and the number read as
   * sitting ON the disc rather than IN it. Found 2026-08-15 on Ramsey (301S / 301V
   * / 301X); March (ZIP2) and St Ives (VL14) have it too, on their external sheets
   * as well as their internal ones.
   *
   * The fix is the SHAPE, not the type. Shrinking the font to fit the disc is the
   * smaller change and it fails exactly where it matters most: fitting "301S"
   * inside a 2.4mm-radius stop badge needs 1.8mm type, well under the 2.4mm print
   * legibility floor `quality_metrics.js` enforces. So the badge grows sideways
   * into a stadium — what operator maps do with a lettered route number — and the
   * type stays the size it was.
   *
   * `badgeHalfW(route, rad)` is the single source of truth for how wide a badge is,
   * and `badgeXW` is the same thing as an EXTRA over the radius. Every pitch, clamp
   * and reserve box below is expressed as `<the old literal> + <extra>`, never
   * recomputed from the half-width, so a town with no long key adds a floating
   * zero and stays bit-for-bit identical (invariant 2). Absent the key `badgeXW` is
   * 0 everywhere and none of it runs at all.
