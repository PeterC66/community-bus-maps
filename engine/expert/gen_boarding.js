/*
 * gen_boarding.js — the "Where to catch your bus in <place>" sheet.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The town and place sheets both answer "where do the buses go".
 * Neither answers the question a passenger standing in a bus station actually has,
 * which is the inverse: "I have decided to go to Bedford — which of these five
 * identically-named stops do I stand at?" This is the third sheet from
 * Development Docs/boarding-plan-product_2026-08-22.md, and its rule 1 is the whole
 * layout brief: two halves, and THE INDEX IS THE PRODUCT. The map is the locator;
 * the index is what answers the question, so the index gets the page and the map
 * gets the corner.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS NOT. Not a route map — no route lines are drawn at all. A reader who
 * already knows their route number does not need this sheet (rule 2), and drawing
 * ribbons here would re-answer the question the other two sheets already answer
 * while crowding out the one this sheet exists for.
 *
 * THE INDEX IS KEYED ON DESTINATION, ALPHABETICALLY (rule 2) — the single biggest
 * differentiator from the published field, and the standing criticism of spider
 * maps: they show where the buses want to go, not where the reader wants to go.
 * `Ramsey -> 301 -> Bay 1` is the row.
 *
 * TWO CLASSES OF BOARDING POINT, both printed verbatim from NaPTAN (rule 3: the
 * letter must match the flag, and a letter we invented is worse than none):
 *   'stand'  the flag carries a code    -> "Bay 4"
 *   'named'  the flag carries a name    -> "The Busway, Station Road"
 * The second class is not a compromise, it is the same rule applied to a BCT flag,
 * and at St Ives it is load-bearing: routes A and B are the busiest services here
 * and their CAMBRIDGE direction never enters the bus station at all. See
 * naptan_stands.py's header for the trace. A sheet that drew only the lettered bays
 * would send every Cambridge passenger to a bay no Cambridge bus stops at.
 *
 * INPUTS, all from the current directory:
 *   routes.json          config; MUST carry a `boardingPlan` block or this declines
 *   stands.json          naptan_stands.py --write
 *   boarding_index.json  boarding_index.py --write
 *   place.json           the anchor
 *   osm.json             POIs for the locator (optional but wanted)
 *   roads_geo.json       street skeleton from pull_roads.js (optional)
 * Output: boarding.svg, A4 landscape at the shared 3508x2480 raster size.
 *
 * DECLINING IS A FEATURE (paper sec 5). No `boardingPlan` key, or a stands verdict
 * other than OK, and this writes nothing and exits non-zero — the same posture the
 * portal's `requiresConfig` gate gives an output whose config key is absent, which
 * is why the portal side of this is a table entry rather than new code.
 *
 * Invariants (changing-the-engine.md sec 1): no network, no Math.random, no Date,
 * no locale-dependent sorting. Same input, same bytes.

 * "I find it hard to envisage it on the ground at the moment" — Peter, on the
 * v1.2 sheet, 2026-08-23. The locator drew streets, four bay markers and one
 * landmark; it did not draw the place. At a ~130 m frame the thing that says
 * WHERE YOU ARE is the built fabric — the shape of the bus station you are
 * standing in, the buildings across the road, the car park behind you — and none
 * of it was in the data. pull_locator.js fetches it; this draws it.
 *
 * Everything here is BACKGROUND and is toned to stay background. The subject of
 * this sheet is four numbered discs, and a building layer that competes with them
 * has made the sheet worse, not better. Order is areas, then buildings, then the
 * streets on top — a street drawn under a footprint reads as a road going through

 *
 * It used to be `distM <= 30`, and the constant was doing a job it cannot do. At High
 * Wycombe High Street Stop R is 9 m out and Stop S is 31 m — the same pair of flags
 * facing opposite ways across one street — so the rule split them by ONE METRE, while
 * the sheet prints "1 min" for both and shows no difference at all.
 *
 * The obvious repair is to key it on `walkMin` instead, and that is WRONG, which is
 * why the row it came from is not being followed to the letter. walkMin is
 * max(1, round(m/80)), so "1 min" reaches 120 m — and at St Ives Bus Station, the one
 * sheet where this caption is live today, 120 m takes in The Busway Station Road at
 * 47 m. That stop is on Station Road and is NOT in the bus station; captioning it
 * "in the bus station" is the exact error the whole sheet exists to prevent, and it
 * would have been introduced by a change made to remove an arbitrary constant.
 *
 * So test the thing the phrase actually asserts. "You are already there" is a claim
 * that the stop is INSIDE the place, and ANCHOR_AREAS is already exactly "the polygons
 * that are this place" — built above from the anchor standing in them or from them
 * carrying the place's own name. Point-in-polygon answers it exactly, at St Ives keeps
 * the three bays and still refuses the Busway, and needs no threshold at all.
 *
 * The metres survive only as the fallback for a place with NO polygon — a shop, a
 * street anchor, a school gate — where containment cannot be asked. There the constant
 * is at least named and settable rather than buried in an expression.

 * reader is standing on. "48 m walk, about 1 min" against a point nobody occupies is a

 *

 * tick and every distance, which is exactly the shape a future "You are here" arrow needs:

/* WHICH STREET DO I WALK TO? -- THE ONE QUESTION THE SHEET WAS NOT ANSWERING (OA-034).
 *
 * At High Wycombe town centre the frame is 240 m wide because the two boarding areas
 * are 230 m apart, and Oxford Street was the ONE street inside it the locator could not
 * label: its own two stops sit on the only stretch in frame, so the name had nowhere to
 * go that was not under a marker disc. Every other street on that sheet is named. The
 * sheet's own subtitle says "Oxford Street and the bus station", and the map was weakest
 * at exactly the place it matters most.
 *
 * `naptan_stands.py` has carried a full NaPTAN block per stop since the file was first
 * written, `Street` included; `boarding_index.py` v1.4 carries it into the stand view
 * this generator reads. So this costs no data work and no second input.
 *
 * WHY IT IS DERIVED AND NOT A CONFIG KEY. `standKeyNames` -- the CommonName beside the
 * code -- already exists and is OFF at High Wycombe town centre, because turning it on
 * prints "High Wycombe BusStn" fifteen times. A `standKeyStreets` flag would be off
 * there for exactly the same reason and for exactly the same fifteen rows: "Bridge
 * Street" fifteen times is the same noise in a different word. A whole-sheet switch
 * cannot express "print it where it distinguishes", which is the only thing anyone
 * wants, so the rule asks that question per stand instead. Four suppressions, each
 * with a case behind it and each measured on the four sheets that exist:
 *
 *   1. NO STREET IN THE REGISTER. Nothing to print.
 *   2. EVERY DRAWN STAND SHARES ONE STREET. St Neots Market Square: five stands, all
 *      "Market Square", which is the name of the place in the title. Five identical
 *      grey lines that answer nothing. This sheet stays byte-identical, which is what
 *      makes it the control for the whole change.
 *   3. THE KEY ALREADY SAYS IT. With `standKeyNames` on at High Wycombe High Street the
 *      key reads "Stop R -- High Street"; appending "High Street" to its own sub-line is
 *      a stutter. Five of the six stands there are in this position, and the sixth --
 *      "Stop T -- Town Hall", which stands on Queen Victoria Street -- is the one whose
 *      street a reader genuinely cannot guess. It is the only line that changes there.
 *   4. THE READER IS ALREADY STANDING ON IT. Where `hereLabel`/`HERE_PHRASE` applies the
 *      sheet is telling them not to walk anywhere; naming a street and then saying "in
 *      the bus station" is two answers to one question. At St Ives the three bays are
 *      inside the polygon and keep their phrase, and The Busway Station Road (47 m, and
 *      outside) gains "Station Road" -- the stop this suppression exists to distinguish.
 *
 * The stand key's width guard below measures whatever this produces, so an overrun
 * refuses the build rather than printing across the destination index. */
