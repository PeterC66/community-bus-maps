// PRINT SAFE MARGIN (design.printSafe, 2026-08-16).
//
// Found by printing two sheets borderless and unscaled, which is the only way it
// could have been found: on screen the footer looks fine. Every sheet ever built
// puts its credit 3 mm from the right trim and its last baseline 4 mm from the
// bottom, and borderless printing over-scales by 2-3% — about 3 mm on A4 — so
// what is left is roughly 1 mm and whether a given sheet looks right comes down
// to the printer's feed tolerance. 5 mm is the conventional floor.
//
// `safe` insets all three edges the footer touches. Absent (null) it is exactly
// today's geometry, so an ungated sheet stays byte-identical. Applied to BOTH
// footerBand and footerPlateTop, because the plate top is computed from bottomY
// and gen_internal.js checks its own map notes against that number before
// drawing them — the two disagreeing is how content ends up under the plate.
// DESCENDER, not baseline. A 5mm margin is a claim about INK, and the last
// footer line is "Valid from July 2026" — the y in "July" hangs below its
// baseline. Insetting to the baseline alone left the ink at 4.41mm and the
// measure still warning, which is the small version of the same mistake the
// whole item is about: fixing the number you thought of rather than the one the
// paper shows. 0.212 em is Arial's descender, the same figure font_metrics.js
// and quality_metrics.js's textQuad both use, so the three agree by construction.

// telling anyone a current version exists. See the publisher benchmark plan,

// guessed: of 78 realistic BusMaps URLs rendered at four modules, OpenCV's
// detector could not LOCATE one of them (Beaconsfield Waitrose at level Q) at
