// FULLY CONFIG-DRIVEN (2026-06-07): every town-specific value is read from
// routes.json — nothing in this file is St-Ives/March-specific, so the SAME
// template runs UNCHANGED for any town. The per-town keys are:
//   routeOrder[]      internal draw order (defaults to palette key order)
//   panelOrder[]      Services-panel list order (defaults to routeOrder)
//   orientationRoute  route used to orient road-name labels (the town circular
//                     if any; defaults to the route with the most in-town stops)
//   atcoPrefix        in-town stop ATCO prefix for road labels (defaults to the
//                     anchor with its trailing digits stripped, e.g. 0500HSTIV)
//   internalDesc{}    {route:[title,subtitle]} for the Services panel
//   poi{}             POI filter/tidy rules (industrialKeep, excludeName, tidy,
//                     canon, include e.g. ["allotments"])
//   internalCorridors bundle co-running services into ONE line with a badge
//                     stack (rung 1 of the complexity ladder) — see the block
//                     where it is parsed, below
//   coreBox           replace the congested centre with a labelled box that
//                     routes are cut at (rung 2)
//   corridorPalette   colour by corridor rather than by route (rung 3)
//   corridorDesc{}    {lead:[title,subtitle]} — internalDesc's twin for a LANE,
//                     used by design.panelCorridors (the badges carry the numbers,
//                     so the row's words describe the corridor)
//   corridorNote      overrides (or, false, suppresses) the sentence the sheet
//                     prints to explain the corridor rule
// (plus anchor/anchorLabel/internalZoom/features/internalBundle/internalTermini

// INTERNAL ROADS MODEL (2026-06-12; DEFAULT since 2026-08-04): the road-
// skeleton drawing model that makes the map read like the hand-made leaflet.
// Needs S2's roads_geo.json (pull_roads.js) + routes_paths.json
// (match_routes.js) — draft_town.py always writes both alongside the key.
// Every built town/place has opted in (8/8 towns, 5/5 places, 2026-08-04),
// so an ABSENT "internalRoads" key now defaults to the standard object below
// rather than falling back to the old classic stop-chord model. Set
// `internalRoads:false` explicitly to get the classic model (kept as an
// escape hatch; no live town uses it). Config (all optional):
//   internalRoads: {

/* ---- design.fixedOrientation — pin which way up this map is drawn -----------
 *
 * DEFAULT IS ABSENT, and absent means exactly what it has always meant: the map
 * is rotated by PCA onto the principal axis of its own stop cloud, to fill A4.
 * Nothing below runs, and the sheet is byte-identical to one built before this
 * key existed. That inertness is the point — 13 live maps rely on it.
 *
 * Accepted values:
 *   (absent) / null  auto — PCA, as before. No fixed orientation.
 *   "north"          north up. Sugar for 0, and the value worth naming: it is the
 *                    one orientation a reader can check against their own sense of
 *                    direction, and the one a council is most likely to ask for.
 *   <number>         any bearing, in degrees, same convention as the existing
 *                    internalRoads.rotationDeg: 0 = north up, and the value is the
 *                    map's rotation, so 90 puts east at the top. Accepts negatives
 *                    and anything outside 0–360; normalised below.
 *
 * WHY A TOWN WOULD WANT THIS. PCA re-derives the angle from the stop cloud on
 * every build, so a route added or withdrawn next month can swing the whole sheet
 * a few degrees. That is invisible in any gate — the artwork is "correct" either
 * way — but it is very visible to someone holding last month's printed copy next
 * to this month's, and it silently invalidates every hand-placed label position.
 * Pinning the angle makes successive months comparable.
 *
 * "AS THE CURRENTLY PUBLISHED SHEET" is deliberately NOT a value here. It cannot
 * be resolved at build time — the published sheet lives on the portal, and a
 * generator that reached out to the network to find out which way up it was would
 * be both fragile and untestable. Instead the generator RECORDS the angle it used
 * (build-meta.json, written when BUILD_META_DIR is set), and freeze_orientation.js
 * turns that recorded number into an explicit `fixedOrientation: <deg>` here. The
 * config then says the angle out loud rather than referring to something absent.

/* ---- G5: twelve keys promoted from per-town config to engine DEFAULTS
 * (2026-08-17, plan Phase 8 item 5) -------------------------------------
 *
 * Measured 2026-08-16: all eight towns, and (bar legendPlace, which lives
 * only on the external generators) all five places, carried an IDENTICAL
 * `design` block. "Should this be a default" was never a live question —
 * it was twelve keys carried as config in thirteen places because nobody
 * had listed the configs side by side. Any key repeated on every target is
 * a default in disguise ([[feedback_engine_vs_config_labeling]]).
 *
 * Each keeps an explicit escape hatch, because ABSENT no longer means off:
 * a target that genuinely needs the pre-2026-08-15 behaviour now writes
 * `design:{key:false}` rather than the plan re-opening. Booleans read
 * `!== false`; `iconInk`/`iconSet`/`cornerRadius` carry a VALUE when on, so
 * `false` reverts to the literal each replaced (full colour / the 12-icon
 * legacy set / a square corner). `labels.engine` accepts `"v1"` as well as
 * `false`, since it is the one non-boolean key with its own vocabulary.
 * `panelCorridors` and `spokeSpread` stay explicit config — the first needs
 * internalCorridors, the second is a per-composition judgement, and neither
 * was ever near 8/8.
 *
 * THE SELF-CHECK: every S3 that used to carry these keys explicitly still
 * carried the same effective value, so stripping the redundant key must
 * leave every shipped byte untouched — proved in scratch before any real S3
 * was touched, then again as rollout.js's byte-identical gate.

//                labelColor,labelItalic,labelSize,labelReserve:[x0,y0,x1,y1]}]
// and their geometry comes from S2's features_geo.json (keyed by feature key:
//   { "<key>": [ [ [lat,lon],… ], … ] }  — array of polyline segments).
// Each feature is straightenable/nudgeable via overrides.json -> internal.features[key]
// (hide, move{dx,dy}, points/segments page-mm arrays, label{pos|offset,anchor,text,hide},
// merged style). BACKWARD-COMPAT: with NO "features" config, synthesize ONE river
// feature from river_geo.json using the legacy style/label so existing towns
// (St Ives, March) stay byte-identical. Per-type default styles:

  // honoured by drawFeature(); a town can still override any of them per feature.
  // minSegLen (page mm): drop polyline segments shorter than this before drawing.
  // A multi-track railway (ECML through a station) is mapped as many parallel ways
  // plus short crossover/point stubs; the stubs' perpendicular ties splay every
  // direction into a mess at the junction throat. Filtering out the short stubs
  // leaves the clean OS through-line. Harmless where a railway has no such clutter.

// CHEQUER railway (Peter's ask 2026-08-15, plan Phase 1b): opt in per feature
// with style:{rail:"chequer"}. A black casing with white blocks laid ON TOP as a
// dash pattern, which the renderer distributes along the WHOLE path — so unlike
// the tie symbol it cannot bunch, reset its phase at a vertex or splay at a
// hairpin, whatever the diagram engine does to the geometry. Chosen because the
// tie symbol is computed per polyline segment: on geographic geometry the median
// segment (1.1-2.5mm) is shorter than the 2.6mm tie pitch, so spacing follows
// vertex density; on diagram geometry (featureDamp warping, turns up to 148 deg)
// adjacent ties cross each other. Picking chequer also turns ties off, retires
// the minSegLen stub hack (no longer needed, and it punched visible gaps in the
// line), and switches on railStitch + railMerge below. Any key is still
// overridable per feature via style{}.
// WEIGHT (plan Phase 6, §3.4): 1.6 mm of #4a4a4a, not 1.9 mm of #333. The
// railway is context; the bus routes are the subject, and they are drawn at
// 1.7 mm. At 1.9/#333 the railway was the widest and darkest single line on the
// sheet, so context out-shouted subject on every geographic town. coreWidth moves
// with width to hold the dark edging either side of a white block at 55% of the
// casing (1.05/1.9) — drop the width alone and the symbol goes pale and mushy
// rather than lighter. The dash pitch is deliberately NOT scaled: it sets the
// symbol's rhythm along the line, which is what makes it read as a railway at
// arm's length. Comparison on all four railway towns, with 300 dpi crops:
// Development Docs\railway-weight-options_2026-08-15.html.

// 31 lines in 12 colours). See references/complexity-triage.md.
//
// HOW IT WORKS — and why the bundle cannot state something false:
// every member KEEPS ITS OWN GEOMETRY. Bundling changes only two things:
//   (a) COLOUR — every member takes the lead's colour (and text colour);
//   (b) LANE — members count as ONE lane in the corridor offset maths, so where
//       they co-run they land on the same centreline and overdraw into a single
//       visible line, and where they DIVERGE they simply separate again, because
//       nothing merged their coordinates.
// So "the bundle must split back where the routes diverge" is satisfied BY
// CONSTRUCTION rather than by a rule someone has to remember. What a divergence
// does cost is identity — both branches are now the same colour — so the badge
// logic below stacks the badges of the members actually co-running AT that point
// and lets a member badge its own divergent branch alone. `corridors_report.json`
// records the shared fraction per member so S6 can flag a weak family.
//
// Absent => every derived value is a no-op identity and output is byte-identical.

// badge-stack order, regardless of how the member list happens to be written.

 * The fix is the SHAPE, not the type. Shrinking the font to fit the disc is the
 * smaller change and it fails exactly where it matters most: fitting "301S"
 * inside a 2.4mm-radius stop badge needs 1.8mm type, well under the 2.4mm print
 * legibility floor `quality_metrics.js` enforces. So the badge grows sideways
 * into a stadium — what operator maps do with a lettered route number — and the
 * type stays the size it was.
 *
 * `badgeHalfW(route, rad)` is the single source of truth for how wide a badge is,
 * and `badgeXW` is the same thing as an EXTRA over the radius. Every pitch, clamp
 * and reserve box below is expressed as `<the old literal> + <extra>`, never
 * recomputed from the half-width, so a town with no long key adds a floating
 * zero and stays bit-for-bit identical (invariant 2). Absent the key `badgeXW` is
 * 0 everywhere and none of it runs at all.

 * the 31 sheets, 34 of them on High Wycombe's internal sheet alone. Nothing in the

 * and in a town centre several land within a couple of metres of each other.
 *
 * This is the standard cartographic answer — displace, don't drop. A few rounds of
 * mutual repulsion, capped so a symbol never strays more than `spreadMax` mm from
 * its true position (default 2.6, about a block at these scales), and hand-placed
 * POIs (overrides pos/move) are pinned and never moved. The label follows its
 * symbol, because both read the same adjusted point.

   * model is drawn with stroke-linejoin="round", so every corner is rounded — but

   * turn that reads as a mitre, not as a drawn curve, which is what a tube map
   * uses. So the item is real and the diagnosis of it was not.
   *
   * It is aimed at the diagram and the schematic, where the turn profile says
   * corners are EVENTS: 76-78% of vertices turn less than 2° and 6-9% turn more
   * than 45°. On a geographic sheet turning is continuous instead (the buckets
   * are flat, ~20% each) because the line is following a real road, and there is
   * no corner to round — which is why the fillet is clamped to half of each
   * adjacent segment. On 1.2 mm road segments that clamp reduces it to almost
   * nothing on its own, so the same key is safe on every model.

/* ---- design.scaleBar: a scale bar, or an honest refusal to draw one ---------
 *
 * §4.6 of the design-quality plan asked for "a scale bar on the geographic
 * sheets and a 'diagram — not to scale' note on the diagram and schematic
 * variants". Measuring the projection before building it moved the line between
 * those two cases, so read this before changing anything here.
 *
 * THE GEOGRAPHIC SHEETS ARE NOT TO A SINGLE SCALE EITHER. Every town runs the
 * radial fisheye in `compress()`: true scale inside `focus.coreKm`, then
 * `focus.comp` beyond it. Measured across all eight towns on 2026-08-15, comp is
 * between 0.30 and 0.50 — so the page scale STEPS BY A FACTOR OF 2 TO 3.3 at the
 * core boundary, and two towns carry a detail lens on top of that. An
 * unqualified bar would be right in the middle of the sheet and wrong by 3x at
 * the edges, which is the difference between a fifteen-minute walk and a
 * forty-five-minute one. It would be worse than no bar at all.
 *
 * What saves the device is that the core is not a small disc: fitted to the
 * frame it is 34-71 mm in radius on a 190x162 mm map, so the true-scale zone
 * covers most of the PAGE even though most of the CONTENT lies outside it. So
 * the bar is drawn, sized from the core scale, and labelled `town centre scale`
 * whenever the town is actually fisheyed. A town with comp >= 1 and no lens gets
 * the bar with no qualifier, because then it really is one scale.
 *
 *   sc is page mm per unit of `planar()`, whose unit is one degree of latitude
 *   (isotropic — planar() scales longitude by cos(lat0)), i.e. 111.32 km.
 *
 * On a schematic or diagram sheet the pre-stage sets `notToScale`, and no bar is
 * drawn at any size: those coordinates are solved onto a tube-map grid and carry
 * no real-world distance at all. They get the words instead.
 *
 * Opt-in, absent => byte-identical. Needs labels.engine:"v2" for the blank-space
 * search, so the five place sheets (still on v1) ignore it until Phase 8.

/* ---- features[].labelPos:"auto" — a feature label that sites itself ---------
 *
 * WHY. A linear feature's label is hand-placed, in page mm, against geometry the
 * town has no control over: the projection, the fisheye and the frame all move
 * when the data is refreshed, and the label does not move with them. Every one of
 * the seven stranded labels found on 2026-08-16 had been put on its feature by
 * hand at some point — Ramsey's write-up even records the river name as having
 * been "moved onto the river it names" — and then the ground moved underneath it.
 * Ramsey's ended up 84mm away, High Wycombe's railway name 75mm, Beaconsfield's
 * A355 108mm, and St Ives' river name under the footer plate where it was refused
 * outright. A hand-set constant cannot survive a moving projection; the guard that
 * caught them is necessary but it only ever produces more hand-set constants.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES. `"labelPos": "auto"` sites the label on the feature's own ink:
 * along the LONGEST run of it that lands inside the map frame, offset clear of the
 * line, on a box that collides with nothing already reserved. It is geometry, not
 * a search over the finished drawing — the reserve pass has to know where the
 * label will be BEFORE the point-label placer runs, or every map label would treat
 * the space as free (which is the bug labelReserve exists to stop).
 *
 * The three preferences, in the order they matter: near the middle of the visible
 * run (a name at a clipped end reads as belonging to whatever is beyond the edge),
 * on a stretch running across the page rather than up it (a horizontal name beside
 * a vertical line points at nothing in particular), and tight to the ink.
 *
 * Opt-in per feature. Absent the string, labelPos is the {x,y} it has always been
 * and the output is byte-identical.

// Bundling asserts that a family runs together. The geometry keeps that honest
// by itself — members separate where they diverge, because nothing merged their
// coordinates — but a family whose members only share half their length is a bad
// bundle even so: most of the sheet is then two SAME-COLOURED lines going
// different ways, which is worse than two colours. Measure it and say so.
//
// The measure is the SAME one complexity_score.js uses to PROPOSE a family:
// mutual overlap of ~111 m cells on the raw matched lat/lon paths, warn below
// 0.6 (its --overlap default). The tool that suggests a bundle and the tool that
// draws it must not disagree about what "co-running" means.
//
// Two measures were tried first and are wrong; recording them so they are not
// re-invented. (a) The lane-bundling test (CORUN / corridor.dist 2.4 mm ≈ 65 m
// at map scale) is right for "should these share a casing" but far too generous
// here — in a dense core it makes almost every route a neighbour of every other.
// (b) Page-space coincidence of the DRAWN lines is circular: bundling is exactly

 * 3.5 / 3.2 / 3 / 2.9 / 2.8 / 2.5 / 2.3 / 1.95) and gave its two section
 * headings, which are peers, different sizes AND different amounts of air:
 * measured on Beaconsfield, `Services` had 5.9 mm of clear space beneath it and
 * `Key` had 3.2 mm, while `Key` had barely more air above it (3.6 mm) than
 * below — so the heading read as floating between the two lists rather than
 * belonging to the one under it. Uneven panel rhythm is among the fastest
 * amateur tells and is entirely arithmetic to fix (plan §4.4).
 *
 * The scale is a 1.2 ratio anchored on the route title and floored just above
 * the 2.4 mm print-legibility threshold quality_metrics.js enforces — the dense
 * two-column subtitle was 2.3 mm and failed it:
 *
 *     2.45  ·  2.9  ·  3.5  ·  (4.2)  ·  5.0
 *
 *   5.0   section heading — `Services` and `Key`, now the same size
 *   3.5   route title (single column and grouped)
 *   2.9   route subtitle, operator group header, Key item, fare note, and the
 *         route title in a dense multi-column panel (one step down)
 *   2.45  subtitle in a dense multi-column panel
 *
 * 4.2 is a step of the scale that nothing in the panel needs; it is listed so
 * the 3.5 → 5.0 jump reads as skipping a step rather than as an arbitrary gap.
 *
 * The rhythm: one rule for every heading, expressed as CLEAR AIR between real
 * ink (cap-top to descender) rather than between baselines — so a 5 mm heading
 * gets the same optical gap over 3.5 mm titles as it does over 2.9 mm Key
 * items, which a fixed baseline step cannot give. Air above a section heading
 * is deliberately larger than air below it, the asymmetry panelGroups already
 * discovered by hand on 2026-08-11 and got backwards on its first attempt.
 *
 * Absent => every size and every gap is exactly the hand-tuned value it was,
 * byte for byte (invariant 2).

 * by corridor. The Services panel then listed every service as an equal,
 * individually-badged row and silently undid both — High Wycombe printed 22 rows
 * for the 14 lanes its own map draws, which is what forced the 4.9 mm row pitch
 * that sits its subtitles on the descenders of the titles below them. So the panel,
 * not the pitch, was the over-stuffing (plan Phase 7; §4.4 warned about it here).
 *
 * ONE ROW PER LANE, wearing the badge stack the map already draws. 22 rows become
 * 14 at a pitch the type scale can carry, with no third column and no dropped
 * subtitles. The external spider has always worked this way (external[].routes).
 *
 * A lane of one route draws exactly as a panel row always has: badge left, title
 * and subtitle beside it. A lane of several puts its badge stack on its OWN line,
 * left-aligned at the column edge, above the text — six 5.2 mm discs are 34 mm
 * across and no title survives what is left of a 49 mm column. Either way EVERY
 * TITLE STARTS AT THE SAME X: a panel is a table, the lesson design.badgeFit
 * learned the expensive way (2026-08-16). The hanging stack then reads as the
 * row's heading, which is what a corridor is.
 *
 * The words come from `corridorDesc: {"<lead>":[title,subtitle]}` — internalDesc's
 * twin for a lane. The badges carry the numbers, so the row's words are about
 * where the CORRIDOR goes, and "these services run together to there" is a claim
 * about the real world: it is declared, never inferred (as internalCorridors
 * itself is). Absent, the lead's own internalDesc is used and the engine says so
 * on stderr rather than quietly labelling six services with one's destination.
 *
 * Absent the key ⇒ this branch never runs and the panel is byte-identical.
