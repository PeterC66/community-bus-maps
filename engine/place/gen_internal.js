// FULLY CONFIG-DRIVEN (2026-06-07): every town-specific value is read from
// routes.json — nothing in this file is St-Ives/March-specific, so the SAME
// template runs UNCHANGED for any town. The per-town keys are:
//   routeOrder[]      internal draw order (defaults to palette key order)
//   panelOrder[]      Services-panel list order (defaults to routeOrder)
//   orientationRoute  route used to orient road-name labels (the town circular
//                     if any; defaults to the route with the most in-town stops)
//   atcoPrefix        in-town stop ATCO prefix for road labels (defaults to the
//                     anchor with its trailing digits stripped, e.g. 0500HSTIV)
//   internalDesc{}    {route:[title,subtitle]} for the Services panel
//   poi{}             POI filter/tidy rules (industrialKeep, excludeName, tidy,
//                     canon, include e.g. ["allotments"])
//   internalCorridors bundle co-running services into ONE line with a badge
//                     stack (rung 1 of the complexity ladder) — see the block
//                     where it is parsed, below
//   coreBox           replace the congested centre with a labelled box that
//                     routes are cut at (rung 2)
//   corridorPalette   colour by corridor rather than by route (rung 3)
//   corridorDesc{}    {lead:[title,subtitle]} — internalDesc's twin for a LANE,
//                     used by design.panelCorridors (the badges carry the numbers,
//                     so the row's words describe the corridor)
//   corridorNote      overrides (or, false, suppresses) the sentence the sheet
//                     prints to explain the corridor rule
// (plus anchor/anchorLabel/internalZoom/features/internalBundle/internalTermini

// INTERNAL ROADS MODEL (2026-06-12; DEFAULT since 2026-08-04): the road-
// skeleton drawing model that makes the map read like the hand-made leaflet.
// Needs S2's roads_geo.json (pull_roads.js) + routes_paths.json
// (match_routes.js) — draft_town.py always writes both alongside the key.
// Every built town/place has opted in (8/8 towns, 5/5 places, 2026-08-04),
// so an ABSENT "internalRoads" key now defaults to the standard object below
// rather than falling back to the old classic stop-chord model. Set
// `internalRoads:false` explicitly to get the classic model (kept as an
// escape hatch; no live town uses it). Config (all optional):
//   internalRoads: {

// it duplicated the portal's own customer-facing version pill. No sheet in the
// estate carries "Map v<N.N>" - measured across all 35 ci-reference sheets on
// 2026-08-28, town and place alike, and all 35 carry "Valid from <date>" instead.

// it as evidence that the stamp renders.

// ---- STRICT_GUARDS -----------------------------------------------------------
// A guard that REFUSES TO DRAW something the config asked for has not done its
// job, but it used to exit 0 all the same -- from the process's point of view it
// succeeded, because declining was the decision. The sheet is wrong and nothing
// on it says so; only stderr does. rollout.js learned to read that stream on
// 2026-08-18 and found 21 blocking warnings across 7 of 13 maps. The portal never
// learned: renderMap.js reads stderr only when the exit status is non-zero, so on
// the success path -- the only path that matters here -- the whole stream is
// discarded unread, and those are the bytes that go public.
//
// So make the refusal itself the exit code. Every spawn path, present and future,
// then catches it through the ordinary error handling it already has, with no
// change at the call site.
//
// Behind a flag because the byte-identical reproduce gate re-runs these generators
// over committed fixtures and some of those legitimately carry warnings. A
// generator that started failing on them would turn that gate red on day one,
// which is the surest way to get a check muted. Unset, this is inert: every
// existing caller behaves exactly as it did.
//
// Counted, not thrown, so one run reports EVERY refusal rather than only the
// first -- and the artwork is still written, so it can be looked at.

// gen_boarding.js, which carried a second copy of all of it. The reasoning went

/* ---- G5: twelve keys promoted from per-town config to engine DEFAULTS
 * (2026-08-17, plan Phase 8 item 5) -------------------------------------
 *
 * Measured 2026-08-16: all eight towns, and (bar legendPlace, which lives
 * only on the external generators) all five places, carried an IDENTICAL
 * `design` block. "Should this be a default" was never a live question —
 * it was twelve keys carried as config in thirteen places because nobody
 * had listed the configs side by side. Any key repeated on every target is
 * a default in disguise ([[feedback_engine_vs_config_labeling]]).
 *
 * Each keeps an explicit escape hatch, because ABSENT no longer means off:
 * a target that genuinely needs the pre-2026-08-15 behaviour now writes
 * `design:{key:false}` rather than the plan re-opening. Booleans read
 * `!== false`; `iconInk`/`iconSet`/`cornerRadius` carry a VALUE when on, so
 * `false` reverts to the literal each replaced (full colour / the 12-icon
 * legacy set / a square corner). `labels.engine` accepts `"v1"` as well as
 * `false`, since it is the one non-boolean key with its own vocabulary.
 * `panelCorridors` and `spokeSpread` stay explicit config — the first needs
 * internalCorridors, the second is a per-composition judgement, and neither
 * was ever near 8/8.
 *
 * THE SELF-CHECK: every S3 that used to carry these keys explicitly still
 * carried the same effective value, so stripping the redundant key must
 * leave every shipped byte untouched — proved in scratch before any real S3
 * was touched, then again as rollout.js's byte-identical gate.

// dash pattern, which the renderer distributes along the WHOLE path — so unlike
// the tie symbol it cannot bunch, reset its phase at a vertex or splay at a
// hairpin, whatever the diagram engine does to the geometry. Chosen because the
// tie symbol is computed per polyline segment: on geographic geometry the median
// segment (1.1-2.5mm) is shorter than the 2.6mm tie pitch, so spacing follows
// vertex density; on diagram geometry (featureDamp warping, turns up to 148 deg)
// adjacent ties cross each other. Picking chequer also turns ties off, retires
// the minSegLen stub hack (no longer needed, and it punched visible gaps in the
// line), and switches on railStitch + railMerge below. Any key is still
// overridable per feature via style{}.
// WEIGHT (plan Phase 6, §3.4): 1.6 mm of #4a4a4a, not 1.9 mm of #333. The
// railway is context; the bus routes are the subject, and they are drawn at
// 1.7 mm. At 1.9/#333 the railway was the widest and darkest single line on the
// sheet, so context out-shouted subject on every geographic town. coreWidth moves
// with width to hold the dark edging either side of a white block at 55% of the
// casing (1.05/1.9) — drop the width alone and the symbol goes pale and mushy
// rather than lighter. The dash pitch is deliberately NOT scaled: it sets the
// symbol's rhythm along the line, which is what makes it read as a railway at
// arm's length. Comparison on all four railway towns, with 300 dpi crops:
// Development Docs\railway-weight-options_2026-08-15.html.
// The base railway `stroke` stays #333333, so a feature that does NOT opt in is
// untouched by any of this. That used to be worth saying because the place
// sheets were still on the tie symbol; MEASURED 2026-08-27 by instrumenting
// every branch and running all 18 maps that have an internal sheet, they are
// not. All SIX maps with a railway take the chequer, the two place sheets
// included, so the tie symbol, its tieEvery/tieLen/tieWidth keys and the

   * model is drawn with stroke-linejoin="round", so every corner is rounded — but

   * turn that reads as a mitre, not as a drawn curve, which is what a tube map
   * uses. So the item is real and the diagnosis of it was not.
   *
   * It is aimed at the diagram and the schematic, where the turn profile says
   * corners are EVENTS: 76-78% of vertices turn less than 2° and 6-9% turn more
   * than 45°. On a geographic sheet turning is continuous instead (the buckets
   * are flat, ~20% each) because the line is following a real road, and there is
   * no corner to round — which is why the fillet is clamped to half of each
   * adjacent segment. On 1.2 mm road segments that clamp reduces it to almost
   * nothing on its own, so the same key is safe on every model.

/* ---- design.scaleBar: a scale bar, or an honest refusal to draw one ---------
 *
 * §4.6 of the design-quality plan asked for "a scale bar on the geographic
 * sheets and a 'diagram — not to scale' note on the diagram and schematic
 * variants". Measuring the projection before building it moved the line between
 * those two cases, so read this before changing anything here.
 *
 * THE GEOGRAPHIC SHEETS ARE NOT TO A SINGLE SCALE EITHER. Every town runs the
 * radial fisheye in `compress()`: true scale inside `focus.coreKm`, then
 * `focus.comp` beyond it. Measured across all eight towns on 2026-08-15, comp is
 * between 0.30 and 0.50 — so the page scale STEPS BY A FACTOR OF 2 TO 3.3 at the
 * core boundary, and two towns carry a detail lens on top of that. An
 * unqualified bar would be right in the middle of the sheet and wrong by 3x at
 * the edges, which is the difference between a fifteen-minute walk and a
 * forty-five-minute one. It would be worse than no bar at all.
 *
 * What saves the device is that the core is not a small disc: fitted to the
 * frame it is 34-71 mm in radius on a 190x162 mm map, so the true-scale zone
 * covers most of the PAGE even though most of the CONTENT lies outside it. So
 * the bar is drawn, sized from the core scale, and labelled `town centre scale`
 * whenever the town is actually fisheyed. A town with comp >= 1 and no lens gets
 * the bar with no qualifier, because then it really is one scale.
 *
 *   sc is page mm per unit of `planar()`, whose unit is one degree of latitude
 *   (isotropic — planar() scales longitude by cos(lat0)), i.e. 111.32 km.
 *
 * On a schematic or diagram sheet the pre-stage sets `notToScale`, and no bar is
 * drawn at any size: those coordinates are solved onto a tube-map grid and carry
 * no real-world distance at all. They get the words instead.
 *
 * Opt-in, absent => byte-identical. Needs labels.engine:"v2" for the blank-space
 * search, so the five place sheets (still on v1) ignore it until Phase 8.

/* ---- features[].labelPos:"auto" — a feature label that sites itself ---------
 *
 * WHY. A linear feature's label is hand-placed, in page mm, against geometry the
 * town has no control over: the projection, the fisheye and the frame all move
 * when the data is refreshed, and the label does not move with them. Every one of
 * the seven stranded labels found on 2026-08-16 had been put on its feature by
 * hand at some point — Ramsey's write-up even records the river name as having
 * been "moved onto the river it names" — and then the ground moved underneath it.
 * Ramsey's ended up 84mm away, High Wycombe's railway name 75mm, Beaconsfield's
 * A355 108mm, and St Ives' river name under the footer plate where it was refused
 * outright. A hand-set constant cannot survive a moving projection; the guard that
 * caught them is necessary but it only ever produces more hand-set constants.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES. `"labelPos": "auto"` sites the label on the feature's own ink:
 * along the LONGEST run of it that lands inside the map frame, offset clear of the
 * line, on a box that collides with nothing already reserved. It is geometry, not
 * a search over the finished drawing — the reserve pass has to know where the
 * label will be BEFORE the point-label placer runs, or every map label would treat
 * the space as free (which is the bug labelReserve exists to stop).
 *
 * The three preferences, in the order they matter: near the middle of the visible
 * run (a name at a clipped end reads as belonging to whatever is beyond the edge),
 * on a stretch running across the page rather than up it (a horizontal name beside
 * a vertical line points at nothing in particular), and tight to the ink.
 *
 * Opt-in per feature. Absent the string, labelPos is the {x,y} it has always been
 * and the output is byte-identical.

/* ---- HAND-PLACED INK CLAIMS ITS SPACE HERE (2026-08-30, OA-148 / OA-124) -----
 *
 * Two things on this sheet are positioned by a person and not by a placer: a
 * `mapNotes` entry, and an `internalDiagram.interchanges` lozenge. Both used to
 * be DRAWN at their hand-authored position and only then reserve() their box —
 * so every pass that ran before them believed that space was empty, and every
 * pass that ran after them was told about a collision that had already happened.
 * Six of the thirteen labels-over-badges on the board were map notes and three
 * were lozenges: the Beaconsfield school-services block over a frame-exit badge,
 * Ely Co-op's AJ2 footnote (the same overlap OA-124 recorded as damage from the
 * lane flip), St Ives' Morrisons note, and the St Ives / St Neots station
 * lozenges with a route badge printed inside them.
 *
 * The position is still the author's — the engine cannot know where a note about
 * three routes stopping at Morrisons belongs, and a station lozenge marks a stop
 * and has nowhere else to be. What changes is WHEN the space is claimed: here,
 * with the icons and the interchange label, before a single badge or road name
 * has been placed. That is the same move labeller.js makes for a `fixed` label,
 * and the same one the feature-label auto pass makes at the end of this phase.
 *
 * And when the space was already taken by something claimed even earlier — the
 * panel, the footer plate, the core box — it says so, by name, on stderr. A note
 * that lands on the services panel cannot be fixed by anything in this file.

// bundle even so: most of the sheet is then two SAME-COLOURED lines going
// different ways, which is worse than two colours. Measure it and say so.

// mutual overlap of ~111 m cells on the raw matched lat/lon paths, warn below
// 0.6 (its --overlap default). The tool that suggests a bundle and the tool that
// draws it must not disagree about what "co-running" means.
//
// Two measures were tried first and are wrong; recording them so they are not
// re-invented. (a) The lane-bundling test (CORUN / corridor.dist 2.4 mm ≈ 65 m
// at map scale) is right for "should these share a casing" but far too generous
// here — in a dense core it makes almost every route a neighbour of every other.
// (b) Page-space coincidence of the DRAWN lines is circular: bundling is exactly
// what removes the lane offset between members, so measuring after it inflates
// every family towards 1.0 (two unrelated High Wycombe routes read 0.70).

/* ---- THE NUMBERED PLACE INDEX (2026-08-30, OA-078) -------------------------
 *
 * 288 labels across the 52 committed sheets could not be placed, and every one of
 * them left its ICON on the map: an anonymous trolley, an anonymous mortarboard,
 * a park with no name. The reader cannot tell what it is and cannot tell that
 * anything is missing either, which is why this was invisible for a month and why
 * `unplaced.json` had to be invented to see it at all.
 *
 * `labeller.js`'s indexPass() offers each of them a NUMBER instead of its name,
 * placed by the same solver against the same ink, and hands back the rows to
 * print. This block prints them, in the panel column under whatever the Services
 * panel finished with. It is the "somewhere for a displaced name to go" that
 * OA-176 said the badge-avoidance widening needed before it could pay.
 *
 * HOW MANY IT ASKS FOR IS THE SPACE IT HAS, and that is deliberate. High Wycombe
 * drops 53 names on one sheet and no A4 panel column holds 53 rows; a block that
 * silently listed the first 20 would read as a complete index and be a lie. So the
 * capacity is measured, the pass is asked for exactly that many, and the remainder
 * is named on stderr as a count — which is a sheet saying out loud that it is the
 * wrong size, and the argument OA-089 (a multi-sheet town) has been waiting for.
 *
 * `design.placeIndex:false` turns it off for a map that would rather keep the
 * whitespace. Nothing else changes: a sheet with no dropped labels emits not one
 * byte of this. */
